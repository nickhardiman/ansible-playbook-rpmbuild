= Ansible playbook for building an RPM

Read package source files from   
https://github.com/nickhardiman/rpmbuild-content.git
and builds these RPMs. 

* ~/bello-0.0.1-1.el9.noarch.rpm 
* ~/cello-0.0.2-1.el9.noarch.rpm 
* ~/pello-0.0.3-1.el9.noarch.rpm 

Playbook builds RPM packages according to specfile and places them in the home directory. 
RPM content is based on this user guide:  
https://rpm-packaging-guide.github.io/.
Search for bello, cello and pello.

A simpler howto is here: 
https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/create-rpm-package.
The weird macros in each specfile are listed here: 
https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/packaging-guidelines/RPMMacros/.
